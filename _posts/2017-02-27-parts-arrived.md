At last!  Two and a half months after ordering this kit, all the parts arrived.  Just in time too.  To complete this horizontal stabilizer, I need the horn (black piece in second picture) which was one of the backordered items that just arrived.  You can see that I riveted it to the ribs that will create the inside end cap for both the right and left elevators.
 
In the morning I continued with the spars and ribs that were cleco'ed last time. I up-drilled, deburred, filed, scrubbed, cleaned, cleco'ed again, and finally riveted.  As I was trying on the skins, I realized that I had the center ribs attached to the wrong surface of the rib base.  So I got to drilled out my first pull-rivets.  It wasn't as bad as I feared.
    
The skins don't fit as nice as the vertical tail skin.  This is a bigger, more complicated surface... maybe that's why.  Once I got enough clecos in though, it did flatten out and I think it'll be okay.  See first pic.
    
Once the skins were inplace, I tested the fiberglass tips.  These will need to be trimmed as well.  But in order to know how much, I need to get the elevators ready.   So I built the elevator horn (second pic), and drill out the holes for the hinges. 
       
That was a full 8 hours.
