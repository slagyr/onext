Drilled out the rivets for the elevator horn.  Some rivets are a cinch.  Other's really didn't want to come out.  In the end, no major damage.  I think I'll be able to rivet the new ribs back in and no one will be able to tell that it was redone.

With the elevators hinged, I was able to line up the fiberglass tips, trim them down and make a nice tight fit.  They line up perfectly with the elevators, unlike the rudder did.

The horizontal stabilizer is ready to be updrilled, yada, yada, yada, and riveted.
