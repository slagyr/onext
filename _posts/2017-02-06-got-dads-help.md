My parents came to visit, and my dad is helping me this week.  You'll see him drilling pilot holes in a critical piece.  He did a fine job.
 
We finished part of a part, needing missing hardware to complete it.

Sonex said I should get the hardware by Feb 18-20.  That seems like an eternity.  And there's still no timeline for the rest of the back-ordered parts.  *-sigh-*

In the afternoon, we went flying.  Since I'm a CFI, I've been giving my dad some lessons in my plane (the one I didn't build).  Hopefully helping him prepare for his private pilot check ride.
