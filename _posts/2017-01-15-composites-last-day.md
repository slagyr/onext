Second and last day of the composites workshop.  The instructor, Scott Vanderveen is an inspriting guy.  Every other tool he pulls out is a tool he built himself.  Like a hot wire CNC machine, 3D printed molds and rigs, temperature sensor/switch...  It makes me excited to build my own tools too.

Today we finished up out projects.  One is a T-Junction with a wooden strong point that you might use to bold it to something.  The other is a wing section with lateral reinforcement to mimc a wing spar.  The parts are so strong and amazingly light.  I had Tristan and Angelique stand on the wing section when I got home and it held them no problem.

Afterwards I flew home and saw a beautiful sunset over Las Vegas.
