That's right.  I got my tailwheel endorsement.  That means when I finish building this plane, which may be several months from now, I can fly it.  Rock on!
 
This afternoon, without help to put the engine back on the bench, I started on a different tail parts.  It bothersome to have more than a couple half-built parts, but all the back order items leaves me few options. 

Every page of the plans call for a piece of hardware that I don't have.  Frustrating!  I wonder if Sonex forgot to put the order in for my hardware until yesterday when the issue came up.  I ordered the kit Dec 12th.  Could it really take more than 7 weeks for JBParts to fulfill the order?

Trying not to let it bother me.  I grow tired of waiting.
