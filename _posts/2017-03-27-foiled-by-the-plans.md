Arg! Following the plans to my best interpretation, I started drilling holes into those side braces.  After drilling 3 of them, it felt wrong....again.  I stopped, and re-examined the assembly, and concluded that they should be inline with the longerons.  That make more sense.  If only the plans had a blow-up of this portion.  I repositioned the braces and drilled all the holes.  The question is, does the brace with extra holes need to be remade?  I decided no.  The holes are small and shouldn't created a significant structural weakness.  I just hope this is the correct position.

When on to tail cover with the lightening hole, drilling holes.
