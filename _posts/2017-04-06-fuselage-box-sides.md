The right side of the forward fuselage box has been riveted today.  Looks nice.  The same process is applied to the left side.  A bit repetative but it's going much faster since all the parts are ready and I've done it before.  It's all clecoed and updrilled ready for cleaning and riveting tomorrow.  The new turtle deck skins should arrive tomorrow as well.
