Knocked out all the missing parts this morning.  Rote manual labor.

With all the parts required for the fuselage box side panels, I proceeded to dill hundreds of holes into the longerons and vertical struts. These have been updrilled and are ready for deburring/riveting tomorrow.

The top left longeron called for two slots, which I assume are for the canopy latches.  See the third picture.  I was puzzled how to make these.  I ended up drilling a line of hole and using a dremel to clean it up.  I accidentally made a couple scratches on the side so I tried to polish them out... that's why its shiny.
