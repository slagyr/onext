Tristan's 6ths Birthday was last week end.  It was a blast.  Preparations began last Friday.  On Monday I began indoctrination to be a pilot for [Elite Flight Jets](http://efjets.com).  Exciting!  In the mist of all that I was able to knock out a couple more parts for the fuselage (two middle pics).
 
Today the build advanced to the assembly of the rear fuselage.  You can see it assembled with clecoes.  Much more work is required on this section.  What's concerning me is that many other parts will be attached to the fuselage but they are not detailed in this part of the plans. I'm worried that I may build it wrong and not realize until weeks from now.  
  
I invited some experienced Sonex builders to check out my work tomorrow.  Hopefully they will have some advise on this matter.
