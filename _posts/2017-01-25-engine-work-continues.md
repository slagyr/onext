Flywheel arrived! I got it Monday like Sonex promised but I wasn't able to work on it until today.  And boy what a productive day!

Yesterday, double tailwheel lesson.  Practiced all kinds of landings, even one-wheel landings.... freaky... and awesome!

Today I: 

* Married the two halves of the casing together.  Goodness, I hope I didn't forget a part in there.
* Inspected all the piston rings.  More on this below.
* Mounted cylinders and attached connecting rods to pistons
* Started connecting the cylinder heads, more to do here.

Starting to look like an engine!

Fun Fact:  Below there an image of the inside wall of a cylinder.  See if you make out the criss-cross texture of the wall.  Why is it like that?  Good question.  Also note the previous picture with the piston and rings.  Those rings go around the piston and make a tight seal with the cylinder wall. Well not tight enough. Ultimately, we want the cylinder rings and wall to make such a smooth surface that oil is able to seep through on a molecular level only.  During break-in, engine are run at high power to force those rings to rub hard against the wall.  That criss-cross pattern provides a uniform "grinding" surface that will wear down to the shape and size of the rings.  You know an engine is broken-in when it stops consuming lots of oil.  Initially, new engines lose a quart of oil every hour or two.  That'll go down to as little as a quart every 30 hours in some cases.  At least that's how I understand it.  If you know better, let me know and I'll update this blog.       

I'm missing a washer.  You'll see the lonely nut in the last picture.  I probably dropped it but I can't find it anywhere.  Even checked inside the cylinder heads, *whew*.  Tomorrow I'll go to the hardware store and see if I can find one identical.
