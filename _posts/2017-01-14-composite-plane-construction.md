Woke up at 4am and flew to Las Vegas.  Beautiful night skyline as I came in for landing into McCarran.  

The composite construction workshop is great; really educational.  We're learning about the fibers, core, filler, and resin material used to build modern aircraft.  So many possibilities.  Composites allow for more flexibility in shape and aerodynamics.  It's also lighter than aluminum. Fun stuff.  I think when I build another plane it'll be a composite.
