With my dad's help we installed the accessory plate along with the primary ignition magnetrons.  On the back side of the engine is a flywheel that spins with the crank upto 2,500 RPM. Attached to it is a powerful magnet.  On the circumference are two magnetron, that generate a spark whenever the magnet passes.  They are gaped at 1/100th of an inch, which seems crazy close.
 
 Angelique made some nice lunch plans for us all.  And in the afternoon, my dad ands I flew to Tucson where we mingled with some F16s practicing.  Fun ride.
