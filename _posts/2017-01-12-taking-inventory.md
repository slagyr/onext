The OneX is a "tail dragger".  Most GA airplanes these days have a tricycle gear configuration where there's a wheel under the nosea along with gears on each wing.  Tail dragers have the third wheel on the tail instead of the nose.  It's old-school.  And the FAA says pilots need and endorsement to fly tail draggers.  Since this OneX I'm building is a single seater, I'll have to get my endorsement in a different plane.  So I took my first lesson toward that endeavor this morning with Chandler Air Service in a Super Cub. 

Afterward, I called Sonex and they informed me that the instructions (plans), were on backorder and I'd receive them soon.  They also recommended that in the meantime I take inventory of all the parts I received.  So that's what I ended up doing all day.  Roughly 500 individually tagged items... at least mostly tagged.  I had to do some googling and guessing to match up the parts with the packing list.  There were a few descrepencies that I sent to Sonex.

In hindsight, taking inventory was super helpful.  I have a much better feel for what parts there are and where I put them!
