Riveting was the name of the game in the morning. I pulled one or two rivets and the horizontal tail was all attached.

Next I revisted the horn ribs that I drilled to short.  I cut these out of fresh sheet aluminum and bent them to shape.  It was all easier than I would have thought a few weeks ago.  This time I measured it all up before drilling.  It fits nicely.  But the right hinge rod isn't going in.  I may need to drill out one rivet tomorrow to get it lined up.
