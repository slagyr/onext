Roughly 800 lbs divided into 8 boxes arrives in a big truck.  No forklift or liftgate so I got to move it all off the truck and into the garage.  *grunt*
 
So many pieces and parts; hundreds, thousands if you count individual rivets. I unboxed pretty much everything and tried to find a temporary home for it all so there'd be space to work in this 1-car garage space I prepared.
 
Now... the only part I couldn't find is the instructions.  I feel like those are important.  I'll have to call Sonex tomorrow and ask about those.
