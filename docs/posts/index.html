        I wish I had enough interesting information to blog every day, but despite the last 17 hours of effort over the last two days, I’ve only got one new picture for you. This is the fuselage box all updrilled, deburred, and ready to rivet/bolt. Lots of bolts are called out...

        I made all the angles and ribs for the fuselage box. It’s a matter of assembling them all now. Not so easy. All the plans are in 2 dimensions, while the real plane is in three dimensions, obviously. The plans try to make up for this by showing multiple vantage...

        </h2>
        The box floor is drilled and clecoed to the walls. All three of those parts are clecoed to the tail. Now there are a dozen or so beams and angles to add strength and rigidity to the structure. That means more sawing, grinding, and polishing. In the second picture you...

        </h2>
        First, I took apart the whole turtledeck assembly. I deburred and cleaned all the parts, reassembled everything, and riveted, and riveted some more. Finally, it’s all done. There are some minor indentations from rivets where the interior formers didn’t push all the way up to the skin. Despite my efforts...

        Yesterday, I got started on the new turtle deck skins. The first step is to attach them to the splice channel. You can see them in the first picture all cleanup up and ready to rivet. Sonex built such a nice crate to ship the skins that I felt bad...
