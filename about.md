Why write this blog?

#### 1)  The FAA
To qualify for an amateur-build certificate, the Federal Aviation Administration requires that the 
"major portion" (>= 51%) of tasks required to build the airplane are complated by amateurs (me).

#### 2)  Be a Better Pilot
In training to become a pilot, one must learn a good deal about how planes work.  But, the inner workings of 
airplanes is a recurring theme encountered by pilots.  Whether it be regular maintenance, or mechanical problems.
I feel the need for more depth.  What better way then to learn about how planes work than to build one.

#### 3)  Build a Better Plane
I see a ton of potential in the aviation industry, particularly GA (general aviation).  I also see a lot of weight 
dragging it down.  Cost of operation is perhaps the biggest ball and chain holding GA back.  Solution: electric planes.
Far fetched probably, but the fisrt step is learning how planes are made.
